# gentle.js

### Description
gentle.js is a Jquery plugin that can replace insults by a cute or lovely expression, as we can see in comments. It is not intended to change the content, but only to hide it. It is an exercice i make at school, for my studies. 

### How it works ? 
To the user, it give him a button that he can enable. If he is enabled, gentle.js will watch the content, and if he read an insult, he will replace it by a nice quote. As a developper, you'll be able to add/remove insult or kindness from theses .json file (according to your language). You can also config how the button will appear in your own script.js. 

### /\ Important /\
gentle.js have to not become a filter for all word you want. The main goal is to hide vulgar words to spread love! It it also does not have to be a censure tool. So the racist, discriminating, or shocking words have not their place in the black list of gentle.js. That's all!
